## Purpose

<!-- What is the purpose of this document? -->

This document defines the governance principles and decision-making guidelines for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Core Values

<!-- What principles guide development decisions? -->

1. **{{Value 1}}**: {{description}}
2. **{{Value 2}}**: {{description}}
3. **{{Value 3}}**: {{description}}

## Decision-Making Principles

### When to Write a Spec

A spec is required when:

- Adding a new feature that affects multiple components
- Making breaking changes to existing APIs
- Changing core architecture or data models
- Work estimated at more than {{time threshold}}

A spec is NOT required when:

- Bug fixes with clear scope
- Documentation updates
- Minor refactoring (no behavior change)
- Dependency updates (unless major version)

### Approval Process

| Change Type | Approvers | Review Time |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Minor | 1 team member | 1 day |
| Standard | 2 team members | 3 days |
| Major | Tech lead + 1 | 5 days |
| Breaking | All stakeholders | 1 week |

### Conflict Resolution

When disagreements occur:

1. **Data first**: Bring evidence (metrics, user feedback, benchmarks)
2. **Prototype**: Build a minimal proof-of-concept if unclear
3. **Time-box**: Set a deadline for decision
4. **Escalate**: If still blocked, {{escalation path}}

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- All code must pass linting
- Test coverage minimum: {{percentage}}%
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Documentation for public APIs

### Review Criteria

- Meets acceptance criteria from spec
- No regression in existing functionality
- Performance acceptable (see design.md for targets)
- Follows code style (see structure.md)

## Communication Guidelines

### Spec Updates

- Notify stakeholders when spec status changes
- Update the corresponding plan file in .plans/ daily during active development
- Archive completed specs within {{time}} of completion

### Blocking Issues

- Raise blockers within {{time}} of discovery
- Tag in {{communication channel}}
- Update the spec or the corresponding plan file in .plans/ with blocker status
